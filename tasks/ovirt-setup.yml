## Summary:
##
##    These tasks configure the "deployhost" with oVirt support
##    and install software/services to support the deployments
##

##
##    Install the OVIRT SDK 
##


## TO BE DEPRECATED: 20220301
## These steps were incorporated into deployer-setup.yml long ago
##
#
#- name: "ovirt-setup : install oVirt SDK supporting packages (RHEL7)"
#  yum: name=python-ovirt-engine-sdk4 state=installed
#  when:
#    - ansible_distribution == "RedHat" or ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
#    - ansible_distribution_major_version == "7"
#
#
#- name: "ovirt-setup : install oVirt SDK supporting packages (RHEL8)"
#  yum: name=python3-ovirt-engine-sdk4 state=installed
#  when:
#    - ansible_distribution == "RedHat" or ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
#    - ansible_distribution_major_version == "8"

## FUTURE SOLUTION: You can try something similar to how aicli is installed
## No testing yet to see how this mixes with RHV vs. oVirt
##
##     pip: name=ovirt-engine-sdk-python version=4.4.0
