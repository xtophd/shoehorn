##
##    High level assertions (validation)
##



##
##    All nodes should have xtoph_deploy.deployhost
##    branch of the dictionary defined.  We can assert
##    a few additional sub parameters.
##



- name: "common-assertions : xtoph_deploy.deployhost validation"
  assert:
    that:
      - xtoph_deploy.deployhost is defined
      - xtoph_deploy.deployhost.ip is defined
    success_msg: "Assertion Passed"
    fail_msg: "ASSERTION FAILED: xtoph_deploy.deployhost is undefined or missing essential data (CHECK YOUR CONFIGS)"



##
##    Nodes that define a platform (which should include
##    every node EXCEPT the deployhost itself) should have
##    a complete xtoph_deploy dictionary.  Validate the major
##    components of the destionary.

      - xtoph_deploy.resource_profile is defined
      - xtoph_deploy.kickstart_profile is defined
    fail_msg: "ASSERTION FAILED xtoph_deploy is missing essential data (CHECK YOUR CONFIGS)"
    success_msg: "Assertion Passed"

    - xtoph_deploy.selected_profile.machine != ""
