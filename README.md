# shoehorn
Ansible role to automate deployment of virtual machines

This is effectively a rewrite of my older project "WS-Deployer-KVM".  The original
project was written and designed as I was learning Ansible, and so there were many
instances where design decisions and coding style where non-optimal.

With this new improved implementation, "shoehorn" is an now provided as
an Ansible role that is native to the Ansible execution design.

I am actively still porting the project over.
